# Odin Project: Landing Page Assignment

## Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to a web development project assigned by The Odin Project. It involves the creation of a web page from a design mockup provided in the form of images. These images dictate the layout, font choices, and color scheme of the final product. The project's purpose is to apply HTML and CSS knowledge practically, building the page piece by piece, and incorporating various elements such as navigation bars, hero sections, content blocks, and footers.

- Practical application of **Flexbox**: Utilizing CSS flexbox to efficiently lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.
- Experience in **Project Setup**: Familiarizing myself with git repository setup for effective version control and understanding the workflow of regular commits to track progress.
- Development of **Problem-Solving Skills**: Advancing my problem-solving skills by researching solutions to issues encountered during the development process, aiming to resolve them independently.
